# PHC
Poker Heads-up Calculator

A simple .NET application for Windows with .NET Framework 4.6 (Windows 10-11) that shows my small work with WPF in Visual Studio (VB.NET) and individual active graphic elements. The application does NOT change the system and NOT read anything from the computer and NOT write anything to the computer. Take the only file PHC.exe, save it anywhere and run it. The last file is the screenshot of the running application.
